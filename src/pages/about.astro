          My programming journey
          <span class="font-semibold">started in 2022</span>, when I began
          writing small scripts for 3D CAD software, I discovered how much I
          enjoyed coding and I've been hooked ever since. What started as a few
          small scripts turned into a whole suite of tools that helped
          streamline our work, and that's when I realized it was time for a
          career change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dove headfirst into web development, spending my evenings (and
          plenty of late nights!) learning everything I could. Fast forward to
          today, and I've earned a few web development qualifications and
          <span class="font-semibold"> built several projects </span>
          that I'm really proud of. For the previous 10 years, I worked as a mechanical
          design engineer in the world of special-purpose machinery and food processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I get to combine my
          <span class="font-semibold">engineering mindset</span>
          with my passion for coding to build responsive, scalable apps that solve
          real-world problems. Whether it's crafting a sleek front-end or getting
          into the nitty-gritty of the back-end, I love what I do—and I'm always
          up for the next challenge.

          Travel & Hobbies
        </h2>
        <p>
          Traveling is a
          <span class="font-semibold">huge part of my life</span>, and I feel
          lucky to have explored so many different parts of the world. It's
          something I plan to keep doing for as long as I can! They say travel
          broadens the mind, and I couldn't agree more—every trip has taught me
          something new about life that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. So
          far, I've visited
          <span class="font-semibold">29 countries</span> and
          <span class="font-semibold"> 6 out of the 7 continents </span>
          , and I'm always excited for the next adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can usually find me out skateboarding or at
          the gym,
          <span class="font-semibold">I love staying active</span>
          and being outdoors as much as possible. On days when I'm too sore to be
          active, I'm also known to grow different types of chilli and strange varities
          vegetables, my rule is if I can buy it in the shops, im not growing it!
          My girlfriend and I also enjoy
          <span class="font-semibold">cooking together</span>, my specialty dish
          is a Caribbean goat curry.
